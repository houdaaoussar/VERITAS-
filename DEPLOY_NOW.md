# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Your System is Ready to Deploy!

All enhancements have been completed and tested locally. Here's how to deploy to AWS:

---

## 🎯 **Fastest Way to Deploy (Recommended)**

### **Step 1: Run the Deployment Script**

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
.\deploy-to-git.ps1
```

This will:
1. ✅ Add all your changes to Git
2. ✅ Commit with a descriptive message
3. ✅ Push to your repository
4. ✅ Trigger AWS Amplify automatic deployment

---

### **Step 2: Monitor Deployment**

1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console:**
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/

2. **Find your app** and click on it

3. **Watch the build progress:**
   - Provision
   - Build (Frontend)
   - Deploy
   - Verify

4. **Build time:** Usually 5-10 minutes

---

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

Once deployment completes:

1. **Click the deployment URL** in Amplify Console

2. **Test the Upload feature:**
   - Go to Upload page
   - Upload your Excel file
   - Verify data is extracted

3. **Check the Calculator:**
   - Go to Calculator page
   - Verify uploaded data appears
   - Check calculations

---

## 🔧 **Manual Deployment (Alternative)**

If you prefer manual control:

### **Option A: Git Commands**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced Excel ingest with intelligent data extraction"
git push origin main
```

### **Option B: Build Locally First**

```bash
# Test build
npm run build
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..

# Then push
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced Excel ingest - tested and ready"
git push origin main
```

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

Before deploying, make sure:

- ✅ All files are saved
- ✅ Local testing completed
- ✅ Git repository is set up
- ✅ AWS Amplify app is configured
- ✅ Environment variables are set in AWS

---

## 🌐 **Environment Variables (AWS Amplify)**

Make sure these are set in Amplify Console:

**Go to:** App Settings → Environment Variables

**Add:**
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3002
```

## 🐛 **If Deployment Fails**

### **Check Build Logs:**
1. Go to Amplify Console
2. Click on the failed build
3. Expand "Build" section
4. Read error messages

### **Common Issues:**

**Node Version Error:**
- Solution: Update `package.json` engines field
- Already set to: `"node": ">=18.0.0"`

**Dependency Error:**
- Solution: Clear cache and rebuild
- Amplify will handle this automatically

**Build Timeout:**
- Solution: Increase build timeout in Amplify settings
- Default is usually sufficient
