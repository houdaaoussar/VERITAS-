# üîç Check Deployment Status

## Your code was successfully pushed to GitHub! ‚úÖ

```
To https://github.com/houdaaoussar/VERITAS-.git
   536c0f5..b395727  main -> main
```

## Now Check AWS Amplify

### Option 1: AWS Console (Recommended)

1. Go to: **https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/**
2. Find your VERITAS app
3. Click on it
4. Look at the latest build

### What to Look For:

**If Build is Running:**
- ‚è≥ "Provision" - Setting up environment
- ‚è≥ "Build" - Compiling your code
- ‚è≥ "Deploy" - Deploying to production
- ‚úÖ "Verify" - Final checks

**If Build Failed:**
Look for error messages in the build logs. Common issues:

1. **Build timeout** - Build took too long
2. **Dependency errors** - Missing packages
3. **Environment variables** - Missing .env values
4. **Memory issues** - Not enough resources

## Common Deployment Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables

AWS Amplify needs these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
USE_DATABASE=false
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

**Fix:** Add them in AWS Amplify Console ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Issue 2: Build Timeout

If build takes too long, you might need to:
- Increase build timeout in Amplify settings
- Optimize dependencies

### Issue 3: Prisma Generation

If you see Prisma errors, make sure `amplify.yml` has:

```yaml
backend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
        - npx prisma generate
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
```

## Quick Check Commands

```powershell
# Check if your code is on GitHub
git log --oneline -5

# Check remote URL
git remote -v
```

## What Error Are You Seeing?

Please tell me:
1. **Where did it fail?** (AWS Amplify console? Local? GitHub?)
2. **What error message?** (Copy the exact error)
3. **Which step?** (Provision, Build, Deploy, or Verify?)

Then I can help you fix it immediately! üîß
