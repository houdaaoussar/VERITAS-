## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Auto-Detection
The system automatically detects your CSV structure:
- Identifies column headers using pattern matching
- Recognizes common variations (e.g., "Amount", "Quantity", "Activity data - Amount")
- No manual column mapping required for standard formats

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
Cleans and validates each row:
- Parses numbers from various formats
- Handles notation keys (NO, NA, NE, IE, etc.)
- Validates required fields
- Converts dates and units

### Step 3: Smart Mapping
Maps your data to the internal model:
- **Activity Types**: Maps fuel types like "Electricity", "Natural Gas", "Diesel" to standardized categories
- **Scopes**: Normalizes "Indirect emissions" → SCOPE_2, "Direct emissions" → SCOPE_1
- **Sectors**: Preserves GPC/CRF sector information in notes
- **Units**: Maintains original units (MJ, kWh, etc.)

### Step 4: Validation & Preview
Before import:
- Shows summary statistics
- Lists all detected activity types
- Displays year range
- Shows error and warning counts
- Previews sample data

### Step 5: Import
Creates Activity records:
- Links to selected Site and Reporting Period
- Stores source metadata
- Maintains traceability
- Skips invalid rows (optional)

## 📊 Example Workflow

```
1. Navigate to "Emissions Inventory" in sidebar
   ↓
2. Select Site: "Headquarters Building"
   Select Period: "2015 Q1"
   ↓
3. Upload: emissions_2015.csv (100 rows)
   ↓

## 📝 Usage Example

### Using the Sample CSV

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

2. Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

The `sample_emissions_inventory.csv` includes:
- 20+ rows of sample data
- Multiple activity types (Electricity, Gas, Diesel, etc.)
- Different scopes (Direct and Indirect emissions)
- Notation keys (NO, NE) for missing data
- Both residential and commercial sectors

### Expected Results
- **Total Rows**: ~20
- **Valid Rows**: ~13 (rows with quantity data)
- **Error/Skipped Rows**: ~7 (rows with notation keys)
- **Activity Types**: ELECTRICITY, NATURAL_GAS, DIESEL, DISTRICT_HEATING, COAL
- **Scopes**: SCOPE_1, SCOPE_2

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **SQLite Constraint**: The `skipDuplicates` option in Prisma is not supported on SQLite
   - Duplicate activities will cause constraint errors
   - Solution: Ensure unique combinations of (site, period, type, date)

2. **Excel Formats**: Only first worksheet is processed
   - Solution: Place data in first sheet or convert to CSV

3. **Date Handling**: Currently assumes full-year data
   - Creates activities with Jan 1 - Dec 31 date range
   - Enhancement: Add support for quarterly/monthly data
