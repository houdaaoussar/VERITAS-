## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended Path)

### For First-Time AWS Deployment:

```powershell
# 1. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to AWS"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/colab-veritas.git
git push -u origin main

# 2. Go to AWS Amplify Console
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/

# 3. Connect GitHub and deploy
# (Follow QUICK_START_AWS.md)
```

**Total time: ~10 minutes** ⏱️

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

Set these in your AWS deployment:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-min-32-chars
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-random-refresh-key-min-32-chars
CORS_ORIGIN=*
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

**⚠️ SECURITY:** Generate strong random secrets! Never use default values in production.

**Generate secrets:**
```powershell
# PowerShell
-join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 32 | % {[char]$_})
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

### API Health
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

### Upload Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/ingest/test \
  -F "file=@test_emissions.csv"
```

## 🔒 Security Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] Strong JWT secrets generated
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Security groups configured (EC2/ECS)
- [ ] IAM roles with least privilege
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts set up
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Input validation active

---

## 📈 Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test all endpoints** - Verify health, API, uploads
2. **Configure monitoring** - CloudWatch logs and metrics
3. **Set up alerts** - CPU, memory, errors
4. **Add custom domain** (optional) - Route 53 or external DNS
5. **Enable SSL** - AWS Certificate Manager or Let's Encrypt
6. **Configure backups** - Data persistence strategy
7. **Document deployment** - Keep deployment notes
8. **Train team** - Share access and procedures

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
- Verify `npm run build` works locally
- Check environment variables are set
- Review build logs in AWS console

### Connection Issues
- Verify security groups allow traffic
- Check CORS configuration
- Ensure environment variables are correct
- Test with curl/Postman first

### Performance Issues
- Monitor CloudWatch metrics
- Check instance/container size
- Enable auto-scaling
- Optimize database queries
