# üö® PRODUCTION UPLOAD FIX - "Failed to upload file"

## The Issue

You're seeing "Failed to upload file" in production. This means:
- ‚ùå Frontend can't reach the backend API
- ‚ùå CORS blocking the request
- ‚ùå Wrong API URL configured

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX

### Check 1: Is Backend API Running?

Open your browser console (F12) and look for errors. You'll likely see:

```
Failed to upload file
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
or
CORS error
```

### Check 2: What's Your Backend URL?

In AWS Amplify, you need to set the correct backend URL.

---

## üîß FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Find Your Backend URL

Your backend is likely deployed to:
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** `http://houdaproject-prod.eba-mqp9cwkd.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com`
- **Or another AWS service**

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable in AWS Amplify

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Click your app
3. Go to "Environment variables"
4. Add or update:
   - **Key:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value:** `http://your-backend-url.com` (your actual backend URL)

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to "Deployments"
2. Click "Redeploy this version"
3. Wait 3-5 minutes

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE: Deploy Backend + Frontend Together

If you don't have a separate backend deployed, let's deploy everything together.

### Option A: Use AWS Amplify for Both

Create a simple backend that works with Amplify.

### Option B: Use the Ingest Endpoint

The frontend already has code to use `/ingest/test` endpoint. We can make this work in production.

## üöÄ QUICK FIX: Make Upload Work NOW

Let me create a version that works without needing a separate backend:

1. Store files in browser localStorage temporarily
2. Parse them client-side
3. Send parsed data to backend

This will work immediately!

---

## üìù What You Need to Tell Me

1. **Do you have a backend deployed?**
   - If YES: What's the URL?
   - If NO: We'll use client-side processing

2. **What's your AWS Amplify URL?**
   - Example: `https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com`

3. **What error do you see in browser console?**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Try uploading
   - Copy the error message

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND

While we fix the backend connection, let me create a client-side CSV parser that will work RIGHT NOW without needing the backend.

This will:
- ‚úÖ Parse CSV files in the browser
- ‚úÖ Show preview
- ‚úÖ Allow import
- ‚úÖ Work immediately

Do you want me to create this client-side solution?
