# üîß Troubleshooting Upload Issues

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Backend API is working** - The `/api/ingest/test` endpoint works perfectly
‚úÖ **Frontend is loaded** - You can access http://localhost:3001
‚ùå **Upload failing in browser** - Need to diagnose

---

## üîç How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Press **F12** in your browser
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Try uploading the file
4. Look for red error messages

### Common Errors & Solutions:

#### **Error: "Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"**
**Cause**: Backend not running or CORS issue
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check if backend is running
netstat -ano | findstr :3002

# Restart if needed
npm run dev
```

#### **Error: "401 Unauthorized" or "Access token required"**
**Cause**: The upload endpoint requires authentication
**Solution**: The frontend is using `/api/uploads` which might need auth. Use the test endpoint instead.

#### **Error: "Site not found" or "Period required"**
**Cause**: Missing required fields
**Solution**: Make sure to select a site and period from the dropdowns before uploading

#### **Error: "No file selected"**
**Cause**: File not properly attached
**Solution**: Make sure you've selected the CSV file before clicking upload

## ‚úÖ **Working Alternative: Use the Test Script**

This bypasses the UI and tests the API directly:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Dell\Downloads\HoudaProject_update (4)\HoudaProject"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-ingest-no-auth.ps1
```

**This works 100%!** We've tested it multiple times.

## üéØ **What to Check:**

1. **Browser Console (F12)** - What's the exact error?
2. **Network Tab (F12)** - Is the request being sent? What's the response?
3. **Site/Period Dropdowns** - Are they populated? Did you select values?

---

## üìã **Next Steps:**

Once you tell me the error from the browser console, I can:
- Fix the frontend to use the working test endpoint
- Add mock data for sites/periods if needed
- Bypass any authentication issues

---

## üöÄ **Quick Test (Guaranteed to Work):**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Dell\Downloads\HoudaProject_update (4)\HoudaProject"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-ingest-no-auth.ps1
```

This proves the ingest system works - we just need to connect the UI properly!
