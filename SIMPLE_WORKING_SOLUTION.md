# ðŸš¨ SIMPLE WORKING SOLUTION - File Upload & Estimation

## The Real Problem

The issue is that we're trying to store files, but in production (AWS), we need a different approach.

## âœ… SIMPLEST SOLUTION - Store File Content in Database

Instead of storing files separately, let's store the **file content directly in the database** as text/JSON.

This will:
- âœ… Work immediately in production
- âœ… No S3 needed
- âœ… No GridFS complexity
- âœ… Just works everywhere

## ðŸš€ What I'll Do Now

1. **Store CSV content as text in database**
2. **Parse directly from database**
3. **No file storage needed**
4. **Fix estimation input to work**

This is the SIMPLEST approach that will work 100%.

Let me implement this now...
