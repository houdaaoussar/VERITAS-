# üîß AWS Amplify Deployment Fix

## The Issue

AWS Amplify is trying to build both backend and frontend, but the backend build is failing because it's trying to use Prisma with a database that doesn't exist.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Since your app uses **in-memory storage** (not a real database), we only need to deploy the **frontend** to AWS Amplify. The backend can run locally or on a separate server.

## What I Fixed

Updated `amplify.yml` to:
1. ‚úÖ Only build the frontend
2. ‚úÖ Remove backend build steps
3. ‚úÖ Remove Prisma generation (not needed for frontend)

## üöÄ Deploy the Fix

```powershell
git add amplify.yml
git commit -m "Fix deployment config"
git push
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Backend Deployment

Your backend needs to be deployed separately. You have 3 options:

### Option 1: Deploy Backend to Heroku (Easiest)

1. Create Heroku account
2. Install Heroku CLI
3. Run:
```powershell
heroku create veritas-backend
git push heroku main
```

### Option 2: Deploy Backend to AWS EC2

1. Create EC2 instance
2. SSH into it
3. Clone repo and run `npm start`

### Option 3: Keep Backend Local (For Testing Only)

- Frontend on AWS Amplify
- Backend on your local machine
- Update frontend API URL to point to your local IP

## üìù After Frontend Deploys

1. Get your Amplify URL (e.g., `https://main.d123abc.amplifyapp.com`)
2. Update frontend API configuration to point to your backend
3. Test the app

## Current Setup

- **Frontend**: Will deploy to AWS Amplify ‚úÖ
- **Backend**: Needs separate deployment ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Quick Test

After deployment:
1. Open your Amplify URL
2. You'll see the frontend
3. API calls will fail until you deploy the backend
