## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do's

- **Use the examples** as a guide for formatting
- **Be consistent** with units across similar activities
- **Include dates** in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Add notes** to provide context (especially for unusual entries)
- **Use dropdown menus** where provided for units
- **Keep quantities positive** - the system expects positive numbers
- **Group similar activities** by location or time period
- **Use any combination of sheets** - you can fill one, two, or all three scope sheets

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't leave example rows** in your upload file
- **Don't use negative numbers** for quantities
- **Don't mix different date formats** - stick to YYYY-MM-DD
- **Don't leave required fields empty** (Activity Type, Quantity, Unit)
- **Don't use unsupported units** - refer to the reference sheet
- **Don't include formulas** - use plain values only

## Data Validation

The template includes built-in data validation for units:

- **Scope 1**: kWh, litres, kg, m3, GJ
- **Scope 2**: kWh, MWh, GJ
- **Scope 3**: passenger-km, tonne, kg, GBP, USD, EUR, kWh

If you need to use a different unit, you can override the validation, but ensure it's a standard unit that the system can convert.

## Example Data

### Scope 1 Example

```
Activity Type: Natural Gas
Location: Main Office
Quantity: 15000
Unit: kWh
Start Date: 2024-01-01
End Date: 2024-01-31
Notes: Heating for January
```

### Scope 2 Example

## Calculation Methods

The system uses different calculation methods based on the scope and data type:

### Activity-Based Calculation
Used for most Scope 1, 2, and some Scope 3 emissions where you have actual consumption data (e.g., kWh of electricity, litres of fuel).

**Formula:** `Emissions = Activity Data √ó Emission Factor`

### Spend-Based Calculation
Used for Scope 3 emissions where only financial data is available (e.g., spend on goods and services).

**Formula:** `Emissions = Spend Amount √ó Emission Factor (per currency unit)`

## Emission Factors

The system automatically selects appropriate emission factors based on:

- **Activity Type** - What you're measuring
- **Geography** - Your location (defaults to UK, can be configured)
- **Year** - The reporting period
- **Unit** - The measurement unit

Emission factors are sourced from:
- DESNZ (UK Government)
- IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
- DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "No emission factor found"
- **Solution:** Check that your activity type matches the supported types in the reference sheet
- **Solution:** Verify your unit is correct and supported

**Issue:** "Invalid date format"
- **Solution:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-01-31)

**Issue:** "Quantity must be positive"
- **Solution:** Ensure all quantity values are greater than 0

**Issue:** "File upload failed"
- **Solution:** Remove example rows before uploading
- **Solution:** Check file size is under 10MB
- **Solution:** Ensure file format is .xlsx or .csv
