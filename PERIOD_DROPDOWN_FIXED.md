# ✅ FIXED: Reporting Period Dropdown

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The "Select Reporting Period for Import" dropdown wasn't working because:
1. The periods API endpoint was using Prisma syntax
2. It needed to be updated to use the storage adapter
3. The default periods weren't being returned

**All fixed now!** ✅

## 📊 Available Periods

Your system now has these reporting periods:

### **Period 1: 2024 Q1** (Default)
- ID: `period_default`
- Name: "2024 Q1"
- Dates: January 1 - March 31, 2024
- Status: ACTIVE

### **Period 2: 2024 Q2**
- ID: `period_q2_2024`
- Name: "2024 Q2"
- Dates: April 1 - June 30, 2024
- Status: ACTIVE

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### **Check 1: Is backend restarted?**
The backend needs to reload the updated code:
```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev:backend
```

### **Check 2: Is frontend refreshed?**
```bash
# In browser, press Ctrl+R or F5
```

### **Check 3: Check browser console**
```javascript
// Open console (F12)
// Look for errors
// Should see API calls to /api/periods
```

### **Check 4: Test API directly**
```bash
# Test periods endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/periods/test
# Should return array with 2 periods
```
