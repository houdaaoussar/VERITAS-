# 🔍 Deep Excel Analysis - Intelligent Data Extraction

## ✅ System Now Takes Time to Analyze Properly!

The system now performs **deep analysis** of your Excel files to find data anywhere.

---

## 🎯 **What the System Does:**

### **1. Scans All Sheets**
- ✅ Checks every sheet in the workbook
- ✅ Scores each sheet based on content
- ✅ Selects the best sheet automatically
- ✅ Logs analysis for transparency

### **2. Finds Headers Anywhere**
- ✅ Doesn't assume data starts at row 1
- ✅ Scans first 50 rows to find headers
- ✅ Looks for emission-related keywords
- ✅ Identifies the row with most column headers

### **3. Extracts Data Tables**
- ✅ Reads all rows including empty ones
- ✅ Finds where the actual data table starts
- ✅ Skips title rows, empty rows, notes
- ✅ Extracts only the data table

### **4. Smart Column Detection**
- ✅ Recognizes many column name variations
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Partial matching (e.g., "Emission Type" matches "Type")
- ✅ Handles missing column names

## 📊 **Example Excel Structures It Handles:**

### **Structure 1: Title and Headers**
```
Row 1: "Company Emissions Report 2024"  ← SKIPPED
Row 2: (empty)                          ← SKIPPED
Row 3: Emission Type | Location | ...  ← FOUND AS HEADER
Row 4: Natural Gas   | Office   | ...  ← DATA STARTS
```

### **Structure 2: Multiple Tables**
```
Row 1-5: Summary table                  ← SKIPPED
Row 6: (empty)                          ← SKIPPED
Row 7: Emission Type | Site | ...      ← FOUND AS HEADER
Row 8: Diesel        | Warehouse | ... ← DATA STARTS
```

### **Structure 3: Notes at Top**
```
Row 1: "Instructions: Fill all fields"  ← SKIPPED
Row 2: "Contact: admin@company.com"     ← SKIPPED
Row 3: (empty)                          ← SKIPPED
Row 4: Type | Quantity | Unit | ...    ← FOUND AS HEADER
Row 5: LPG  | 800      | kg   | ...    ← DATA STARTS
```

## 🔍 **Header Detection Logic:**

The system looks for rows that:
1. **Have at least 3 non-empty cells**
2. **Contain emission-related keywords**:
   - emission, type, category
   - quantity, consumption, amount
   - site, location, facility
   - date, start, end

3. **Have the most columns** (if multiple candidates)

---

## 📋 **Column Name Flexibility:**

### **Emission Type:**
- Emission Type, Type, Category
- Fuel Type, Source, Emission Category

### **Quantity:**
- Consumption, Quantity, Amount
- Usage, Volume

### **Location:**
- Location, Site, Site Name
- Facility, Building

### **Unit:**
- Unit, Units, UOM

### **Dates:**
- Activity Date Start, Start Date, From Date
- Activity Date End, End Date, To Date
