## ‚úÖ What You DON'T Need to Provide

### ‚ùå You DON'T need to:
- Specify the scope (Scope 1, 2, or 3) - **System determines this automatically**
- Provide emission factors - **System selects appropriate factors**
- Know technical emission factor sources - **System uses latest DESNZ/IPCC data**
- Calculate emissions yourself - **System does all calculations**
- Worry about complex categories - **Just use simple names**

### ‚úÖ You ONLY need to:
- Know what you consumed (Natural Gas, Electricity, etc.)
- Know how much you consumed (1500 kWh, 800 litres, etc.)
- Know where it was consumed (Main Office, Fleet, etc.)
- Know when it was consumed (dates)

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Step 1: You Upload Your Data
```csv
Emission Source,Site/Location,Activity Data,Unit,Start Date,End Date,Notes
Natural Gas,Main Office,1500,kWh,2024-01-01,2024-01-31,Office heating
Electricity,Main Office,25000,kWh,2024-01-01,2024-01-31,Office electricity
Diesel,Fleet,800,litres,2024-01-01,2024-01-31,Company vehicles
```

### Step 2: System Processes It

**For Natural Gas:**
- ‚úÖ Recognizes as "Stationary Combustion"
- ‚úÖ Classifies as Scope 1 (direct emission)
- ‚úÖ Selects emission factor: 0.0002027 kgCO2e/kWh (DESNZ 2025)
- ‚úÖ Calculates: 1500 √ó 0.0002027 = 0.304 kgCO2e

**For Electricity:**
- ‚úÖ Recognizes as "Purchased Electricity"
- ‚úÖ Classifies as Scope 2 (purchased energy)
- ‚úÖ Selects emission factor: 0.00019338 kgCO2e/kWh (DESNZ 2025)
- ‚úÖ Calculates: 25000 √ó 0.00019338 = 4.835 kgCO2e

**For Diesel:**
- ‚úÖ Recognizes as "Mobile Combustion"
- ‚úÖ Classifies as Scope 1 (direct emission)
- ‚úÖ Selects emission factor: 0.000239 kgCO2e/kWh (DESNZ 2025)
- ‚úÖ Calculates emissions

### Step 3: You Get Results

**By Scope:**
- Scope 1 Total: X kgCO2e
- Scope 2 Total: Y kgCO2e
- Scope 3 Total: Z kgCO2e
- **Total Emissions: X + Y + Z kgCO2e**

**By Category:**
- Natural Gas: 0.304 kgCO2e
- Electricity: 4.835 kgCO2e
- Diesel: ... kgCO2e

- ‚úì Use the exact date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- ‚úì Delete all example rows before adding your data
- ‚úì Double-check your quantities and units
- ‚úì Add notes for clarity
- ‚úì Test with preview mode first (`save=false`)

### Don'ts ‚úó
- ‚úó Don't include scope numbers - system does this
- ‚úó Don't try to calculate emissions yourself
- ‚úó Don't use commas in numbers (25,000)
- ‚úó Don't mix date formats
- ‚úó Don't leave required fields empty
- ‚úó Don't include the example data in your upload

## üîß Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to know which scope my emissions belong to?
**A:** No! Just enter the emission source (like "Natural Gas" or "Electricity") and the system automatically determines the scope.

### Q: Do I need to provide emission factors?
**A:** No! The system automatically selects the most appropriate and up-to-date emission factors from its database.

### Q: What if I have data for multiple sites?
**A:** Perfect! Just add multiple rows with different site names. The system will track emissions by site.

### Q: Can I upload data for different time periods?
**A:** Yes! Use different date ranges for different rows. You can have monthly, quarterly, or annual data.

### Q: What emission factor sources does the system use?
**A:** The system uses the latest emission factors from:
- DESNZ 2025 (UK Government)
- DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs)
- IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)

### Q: Can I see which emission factors were used?
**A:** Yes! After calculations, you can view the emission factors that were applied to each activity.

## üì§ Upload Process

### Preview Mode (Recommended First)
```bash
POST /api/ingest?save=false
- file: your_data.csv
- customerId: <id>
- periodId: <id>
```

**Check the response:**
- How many rows were imported successfully?
- Any validation errors?
- Are the mappings correct?

### Save Mode (After Preview Looks Good)
```bash
POST /api/ingest?save=true
- file: your_data.csv
- customerId: <id>
- periodId: <id>
```

**Data is saved and ready for calculations!**

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Emission source not recognized"
**Solution:** Check the supported emission sources list above. Use simple, common names like "Natural Gas" not "NG" or "Gas".

### Issue: "Invalid date format"
**Solution:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format exactly (e.g., 2024-01-31).

### Issue: "Activity data must be positive"
**Solution:** Ensure all quantities are positive numbers without text or special characters.

### Issue: "Unit not supported"
**Solution:** Check the supported units list. Use standard units like kWh, litres, kg, m¬≥.

### Issue: "Site not found"
**Solution:** Either use an existing site name or enable auto-creation when uploading.
