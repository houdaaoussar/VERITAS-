- ‚úì Use consistent units within each category
- ‚úì Keep date ranges logical and non-overlapping

### Organization
- ‚úì Group similar activities together
- ‚úì Use consistent site names
- ‚úì Add descriptive notes for unusual entries
- ‚úì Separate data by reporting period
- ‚úì Keep a backup of your original files

- ‚úì Double-check emission factors against official sources
- ‚úì Verify units match the activity type
- ‚úì Ensure dates are in correct format
- ‚úì Review calculations before upload
- ‚úì Use preview mode to validate data

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This:
- Leave example rows in your upload
- Use commas in numbers (25,000)
- Mix date formats
- Use negative quantities
- Leave required fields empty
- Use unsupported units
- Include formulas or calculations
- Mix different scopes in the same row

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:
- Delete all example rows before adding your data
- Use plain numbers (25000)
- Always use YYYY-MM-DD format
- Use positive numbers only
- Fill all required columns
- Check supported units list
- Use plain values only
- Keep one scope per row

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid emission category"
**Solution**: Check the emission category matches one of the supported categories listed in this guide. Use the exact format shown.

### Issue: "Activity data amount must be positive"
**Solution**: Ensure all quantities are positive numbers without text or special characters.

### Issue: "Invalid date format"
**Solution**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format exactly (e.g., 2024-01-31, not 31/01/2024).

### Issue: "Emission factor unit doesn't match activity unit"
**Solution**: Ensure your emission factor unit corresponds to your activity data unit (e.g., if activity is in kWh, emission factor should be kgCO2e/kWh).

### Issue: "Site not found"
**Solution**: Either use an existing site name or enable auto-creation when uploading.

## üéì Advanced Tips

### Using Custom Emission Factors
If you have organization-specific or region-specific emission factors:
1. Include them in the "Emission Factor" column
2. Document the source in "Emission Factor Source"
3. Ensure the unit matches your activity data unit

### Tracking Multiple Locations
Use consistent site naming:
```csv
London Office,Purchased Electricity,15000,kWh,...
Manchester Office,Purchased Electricity,12000,kWh,...
Birmingham Office,Purchased Electricity,10000,kWh,...
```

### Quarterly Reporting
Use date ranges for quarters:
```csv
...,2024-01-01,2024-03-31,... # Q1
...,2024-04-01,2024-06-30,... # Q2
...,2024-07-01,2024-09-30,... # Q3
...,2024-10-01,2024-12-31,... # Q4
```

### Handling Missing Emission Factors
If you don't have emission factors:
1. Leave the emission factor columns empty
2. The system will auto-select appropriate factors
3. Review the selected factors in the calculation results

## üìä What Happens After Upload?

### Data Processing
1. **Validation**: System checks all required fields and data formats
2. **Mapping**: Columns are mapped to database fields
3. **Factor Matching**: Emission factors are validated or auto-selected
4. **Activity Creation**: Valid rows are converted to activity records
5. **Site Linking**: Activities are linked to sites (created if needed)

### Next Steps
1. **Review Activities**: Verify activities were created correctly
2. **Run Calculations**: Execute emission calculations
3. **View Results**: Check calculated emissions by scope
4. **Generate Reports**: Create reports for stakeholders
